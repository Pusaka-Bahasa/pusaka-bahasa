## Description

The innovative platform PusakaBahasa aims to preserve and promote regional languages in Indonesia. This platform aims to maintain Indonesia's linguistic and cultural wealth in an interactive and enjoyable way. Here are some of PusakaBahasa's key features:

1. PusakaBahasa offers a variety of courses to learn regional languages in Indonesia. Different learning levels, from beginners to advanced, can meet the learning needs of these courses. With tailored materials, users can learn vocabulary, grammar, and everyday expressions in their chosen regional language.
2. Interactive Learning Materials: This platform employs interactive learning methods that include quizzes, speaking exercises, and conversation simulations. The materials aim to enhance user engagement and enjoyment during the learning process, while also accelerating their mastery of the regional language they are studying.
3. Cultural Wealth: In addition to language materials, PusakaBahasa also introduces users to the culture and traditions related to the language. This includes information about customs, festivals, traditional foods, and other relevant cultural aspects.
4. Digital Resources: PusakaBahasa offers a variety of digital resources, including videos, audio, and reading materials, which are accessible at any time and from any location. This allows users to learn flexibly according to their time and needs.
5. Community and Support: This platform also offers community features where users can interact with fellow learners and native speakers. This feature allows users to practice the language in real-time, share experiences, and receive assistance from the community.
6. Sustainable Development: PusakaBahasa is committed to continuously updating and adding new courses and materials. We do this to guarantee the platform's relevance and its ability to adapt to the changing needs of its users.

With this approach, PusakaBahasa aims not only to teach regional languages but also to strengthen cultural identity and promote linguistic diversity in Indonesia. This platform aims to create a fun and immersive learning environment for all users interested in studying the regional languages of Indonesia.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
